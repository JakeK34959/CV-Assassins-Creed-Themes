Assassin's Creed Logo Resource Pack - by McHeisenburglar

Info:

This is a pack containing all emblems and text logos you'll need when designing Assassin's Creed-related graphics, as well as the Trajan Pro font, which is the closest font you can get for AC (do not use the fan-made one found on Google by the name of Assassin Font). All of these are made from official resources, none are fan-made or ripoffs and they're higher quality than you'll probably ever need. I hope you find this pack useful :)

If you need help with creating AC graphics, I will have a detailed, but easy tutorial on YouTube soon enough. (I have one already uploaded, but I will be updating it for easier viewing). Subscribe to my YouTube channel to look out for that.

I did not create any of these images myself, I merely archived them into a single pack. 95% of credit goes to the amazing folks at TheVideoGameGallery.com, where I found all of the insignias and text logos of AC. They are of a quality that's better than anything you'll probably ever find online. They were also kind enough to upload some images upon my request.

I'd also like to thank Artif4ct on DeviantArt who provided the Abstergo Entertainment and Abstergo Entertainment Color logo PNGs.
